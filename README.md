## About The Project

* Overview:
This project simulates an automated banking system with multiple banks and customers interacting to request and process loans. The system is implemented in Erlang and consists of three modules: bank, customer, and money. Each module plays a specific role in the simulation.

* The project starts by reading customer and bank information from input files.
* Customer and bank processes are spawned and registered to simulate real-world entities.
* Customers seek loans from banks with random loan amounts.
* Banks respond to loan requests based on their available money resources.
* Transaction logs are continuously updated, showing loan requests, approvals, and denials.
* The project provides insights into the total objectives and received amounts of customers.
* The financial status of each bank is tracked, including original and remaining money resources.

* Usage: To use this automated banking system simulation:

  * Compile the Erlang code.
  * Provide input files with customer and bank information.
  * Run the simulation using the money:start/1 function with the input file names as arguments.
  * Observe the transaction logs and banking reports generated by the simulation.
